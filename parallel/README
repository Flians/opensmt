# to solve instances on QF_LRA logic #

  1) compile opensmt (shell in the working path of this README):
    cd ..
    autoreconf --force --install
    ./configure
    make
    cd parallel

  2) and then compile the parallel implementation:
    cd ./clause-sharing
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd ../..

  3) run the automated script and provide QF_LRA SMT instances (this will print an help message):
    ./sample.sh



# to solve instances on QF_UF logic #

  4) do step 1) and 2) if not done yet
  
  5) shell in the working path of this README:
    $YOUR_EDITOR clause_server/src/solver-opensmt/Solver.cpp
  
  6) comment line 187 and uncomment line 186 then save
    make

  7) do step 3 and provide QF_UF SMT instances
